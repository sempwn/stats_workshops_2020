# Statistics Introduction

Idea for course will be to have a combined introductory stats and R course running over four hour-long sessions. The overall lesson plan will be as follows:

* Lesson 1: Types of data and an intro to the R programming language and R studio
* Lessons 2: Descriptive statistics and data visualization
* Lesson 3: Statistical hypotheses and statistical tests
* Lesson 4: Statistical modelling (ANOVA and logistic regression)
