# Statistics Introduction

Idea for course will be to have a combined introductory stats and R course running over four hour-long sessions. The overall lesson plan will be as follows:

* Lesson 1: Types of data and an intro to the R programming language and R studio
* Lessons 2: Descriptive statistics and data visualization
* Lesson 3: Statistical hypotheses and statistical tests
* Lesson 4: Statistical modelling (ANOVA and logistic regression)

## Ideas

* Lessons 1
  * Open Rstudio and R: introduction to program flow and overview of different section
  * Writing first code in R. Can execute in the console or in a script (idea of a recipe)
  * Recipe with different ingredients: Use of functions
  * Types of Data: Nominal, ordinal, discrete, and continuous
  * Nominal data in R: factors
  * Using factors to produce a contingency table

* Lesson 2
  * Recap
  * Lots of recipes using a library
  * Introduce the data frame
  * Some plotting in ggplot (think about spread, central tendency, and correlation)
  * Describing continuous data: median, interquartile range
  * Describing discrete data: contingency table

* Lesson 3
  * Back with the data table, group by 
  * Where do statistical hypotheses come from?
  * How to interpret p-values
  * Back to dataframe: tests for continuous data
  * parametric and non-parametric tests
  
* Lesson 4
  * Model development and goals
  * linear regression
  * logistic regression
  * interpreting model p-values and adjusted/unadjusted odds ratios
